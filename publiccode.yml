    longDescription: >
      This project is the result of a collaboration between WRI ([World
      Resources Institute](http://wri-india.org/)) and KMRL ([Kochi Metro Rail
      Limited](http://kochimetro.org/)).

      Initially developed for use by KMRL, the source code has been 
      open-sourced so it can grow and get better with community inputs and  help
      for creating GTFS feeds for other transit agencies too.

      This program adheres strictly to the static GTFS (General Transit  Feed
      Specification Reference) open transit data specs as published by  Google
      Transit here:
      [https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/)

      Note: We have created a second complimentary application
      [**Payanam**](https://github.com/WRI-Cities/payanam)  to address needs
      where a) the system is simple and routes don't have  variations; b)
      properly mapped stops data is not available to begin  with.
       [**Payanam**](https://github.com/WRI-Cities/payanam) can take you from nothing up to a basic GTFS, and after that you can use this application to edit it. So check it out!

      Lead programmer as of July 2019: [Nikhil VJ](https://nikhilvj.co.in/) from
      Pune, India.
